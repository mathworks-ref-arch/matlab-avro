# MATLAB&reg; Interface *for Apache Avro*â„¢

## Basic installation
To install this package:

1. Fetch the source
Fetch the source code, documentation and other files from GitHub.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-avro.git
```

2. Create the matlabavro JAR file
Use Maven to download the Avro Java API jar file and place the matlabavro JAR file in the 'lib' folder. Please see [detailed instructions to rebuild](Rebuild.md) for more details.

```bash
cd Software/Java
mvn dependency:copy
```

3. Start MATLAB and update paths.
Start MATLAB and update the MATLAB path. A startup script has been provided for this purpose.

```matlab
cd Software/MATLAB/
startup
```
The startup script adds an entry to the dynamic class path for the Avro JAR file. To set the static path, create a javaclasspath.txt file in the [prefdir](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/prefdir.html) folder. Add the path to the Avro JAR file in javaclasspath.txt.

More information on setting the static class path is [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/static-path.html). Restart MATLAB after adding the path for the Avro JAR package.

4. Run unit tests
Run the unit tests using MATLAB's test framework. Please see the [documentation](BasicUsage.md) and  study the tests under the *test/unit* folder to understand the capabilities of this package.

```bash
cd /test/unit
runtests
```

## Advanced
To make this package always available in MATLAB, save the paths to the MATLAB path using *pathtool*. Additionally, create a file called *javaclasspath.txt* in the user's preferences directory ([prefdir](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/prefdir.html)) containing the path to the Avro JAR file.
