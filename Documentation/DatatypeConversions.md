> **Note on specialized MATLAB data types (i.e. cell array or table)** The cell array and other MATLAB objects do not have direct equivalent in Avro or many of the languages and environments that may support Avro. When using avro to serialize data between different applications, it is strongly recommended that uniquely MATLAB data types not be used and instead core avro types be used instead. 

> The MATLAB Data file (.mat) supports reading and writing any MATLAB object, and represents the best way to serialize data to and from MATLAB.

Writing cell arrays to Avro: 
When using avrowrite for a cell array, the data will be represented as a union of some type in Avro. For a MATLAB cell array that only contains data of the same type, it will be converted to a matrix using [cell2mat](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2022a/matlab/ref/cell2mat.html). In Avro this will be a union with an Avro type corresponding to the underlying MATLAB data type within the cell. However, if the cell cannot be converted using cell2mat, it will instead be converted to a structure using [cell2table](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2022a/matlab/ref/cell2table.html) and [table2struct](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2022a/matlab/ref/table2struct.html). The resulting struct will be written in Avro as a Union of an Avro Record. Field names are automatically generated by cell2table.

Writing a MATLAB table, or timetable to Avro:
There is no tabular data type in Avro. The table will be converted to a structure using [table2cell](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2022a/matlab/ref/table2cell.html) and [cell2struct](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2022a/matlab/ref/cell2struct.html) then written as an Avro Record.
