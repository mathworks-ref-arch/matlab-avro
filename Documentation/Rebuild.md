# Building the MATLAB&reg; Interface *for Apache Avro*â„¢ from source
The MATLAB interface for Avro can be rebuilt from source. The rebuilding of
this project can be accomplished by building the underlying JAR
artifacts.

## Requirements
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- MATLAB 2017b or later

## Fetch the source
For developers wanting to go through the build process, make sure to clone
the project first and checkout master.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/matlab-avro.git
```

If working on an existing repository make sure its up to-date.

```bash
git pull
```

## Rebuilding the Java components
The JAR library can be rebuilt using:

```bash
cd Software/Java

mvn clean package
